This code defines a class called Graph, which can be used to represent a graph data structure. The class includes various functions for creating, manipulating, and traversing the graph.

To use this code, you need to create an instance of the Graph class and call its member functions to perform various operations on the graph. Here is an example of how you might use this code to create a graph, add edges to it, and perform a breadth-first search

#include <iostream>
#include "Graph.h"

int main() {
    Graph g(6); // create a graph with 6 vertices

    g.insertEdge(0, 1, 1); // add edge from vertex 0 to vertex 1
    g.insertEdge(0, 2, 1); // add edge from vertex 0 to vertex 2
    g.insertEdge(1, 2, 1); // add edge from vertex 1 to vertex 2
    g.insertEdge(2, 3, 1); // add edge from vertex 2 to vertex 3
    g.insertEdge(3, 4, 1); // add edge from vertex 3 to vertex 4
    g.insertEdge(4, 5, 1); // add edge from vertex 4 to vertex 5

    std::cout << "BFS traversal starting from vertex 0: ";
    g.breadthfirstSearch(0); // perform breadth-first search starting from vertex 0
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
Note that you will also need to include the header file for the Graph class (in this example, assumed to be called "Graph.h").
